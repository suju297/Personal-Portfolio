To address the inefficiencies of manual inventory management in the Moving and Storage Rental Services industry, I developed a comprehensive database system with an integrated graphical user interface (GUI). The system, built on Microsoft SQL Server, features advanced data handling, security measures, and a unique reward system to incentivize vehicle drop-offs at high-demand locationsâ€”solving a common logistical issue faced by companies like U-Haul.

The GUI, developed using Flask, provides an intuitive interface for managing truck and trailer rentals, customer data, and booking transactions. This solution optimizes inventory management, streamlines operations, and enhances service efficiency, making it ready for real-world application.
