Developed as part of the Network Structure and Cloud Computing course, this project focuses on creating a cloud-native application with a CI/CD pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The application uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment, Terraform for infrastructure management, and Cloud Functions for serverless operations.

Key features include VPC networking, Cloud SQL for data storage, Auto Scaling Groups for scaling, and robust security managed through Cloud Key Management. Monitoring and logging are handled by Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging.
